Description: CellProfiler (CP) and CellProfiler Analyst(CPA) are tools for analysing image sets of cells. The software is designed to enable biologists to easily quantitate phenotypes from thousands of images automatically. CellProfileR, a library for the statistical programming environment R, enables the users of CP/CPA to easily interface their databases with R. This is particularly useful where more sophisticated downstream analyses are required. Convenience functions and a number of workflows are provided.
